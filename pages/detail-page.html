          "Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 –
          27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly
          known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical
          general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to
          recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation,
          and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a
          machine. As a result, she is sometimes regarded as the first to
          recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and one of the
          first computer programmers." - Read more at
